# VSD RISC-V SoC Design Course

This repository documents my complete journey through the **VSD RISC-V SoC Design Course**.  
It serves as a structured collection of notes, labs, and projects covering the **end-to-end flow of RISC-V SoC design** ‚Äî from the fundamentals to advanced tapeout preparation.

## üìå Course Overview
The course is designed to provide **hands-on experience** with RISC-V based SoC design, verification, and implementation using open-source EDA tools. It follows an industry-standard flow:

- **Introduction to RISC-V & SoC Basics**  
- **RTL Design & Verilog Fundamentals**  
- **Functional Verification**  
- **Logic Synthesis & Gate-level Optimization**  
- **Physical Design Flow**  
- **Design for Testability (DFT)**  
- **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**  

## üìÇ Repository Structure
Each folder in this repo corresponds to a specific phase of the course:

- `01_riscv_basics/` ‚Äì RISC-V ISA & toolchain setup  
- `02_rtl_design/` ‚Äì Verilog RTL design examples & practice  
- `03_verification/` ‚Äì Testbenches & functional verification
